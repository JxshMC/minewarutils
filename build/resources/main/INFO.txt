Minewar-Utils Plugin Documentation
Version: 1.0-DEV Author: Jxsh

Overview
Minewar-Utils is a comprehensive utility plugin designed to enhance server management and player experience. It features a robust Chat Manager, a fully customizable Scoreboard, Sneak Mechanics, and a Preferences GUI for players. It seamlessly integrates with PlaceholderAPI and LuckPerms for dynamic formatting.

Features
1. Chat Manager
The Chat Manager provides extensive control over the server chat:

Chat Formatting: customizable formats for groups (Owner, etc.) and default players. Supports Legacy (&), MiniMessage (), and Hex colors.
Global Mute: Admins can mute the global chat to prevent players from speaking.
Slow Mode: Enforce a cooldown between messages (e.g., 5s, 10s) to prevent spam.
Chat Clearing: Clear the chat history for all players (with bypass permissions).
Mentions:
Highlight player names in yellow (e.g., @Jxsh) when mentioned.
Plays a sound (minecraft:entity.villager.ambient) to the mentioned player.
Players can toggle mention notifications on/off via /mentiontoggle or the GUI.
Staff Chat: A dedicated channel for staff communication (toggled via plugin messages/commands).
Link Wrapping: Automatically makes URLs clickable with hover text.
2. Scoreboard System
A lightweight, flicker-free sidebar scoreboard:

Fully Configurable: Customize the title and lines in scoreboard.yml.
Conditional Replacements: Dynamically replace text based on placeholder values (e.g., change output if a value is "null" or empty).
Supports Placeholders: Full PlaceholderAPI support for dynamic stats.
Toggleable: Can be enabled/disabled in config.
3. Sneak Mechanics
Fun interactions when players sneak (crouch):

Particle Effects: Spawn particles (e.g., HEART) above the player.
Item Drops: Option to drop a "fake" item (like a Diamond) named after the player.
Configurable: Enable/disable specific users, change particle type, count, and dropped item.
4. Preferences GUI
A user-friendly GUI for players to manage their settings:

Toggle Mentions: Enable/disable mention pings.
Toggle PMs: Enable/disable private messages (if fully implemented).
Staff Controls: Staff members can access Mute Chat and Slow Chat settings directly from the GUI.
Command: Accessed via /percentages (alias: /prefs, /settings).
